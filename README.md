## Data and Source Description
#### Dataset : Adult Census Income from Kaggle
#### Source of the Data :  
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income

This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). The prediction task is to predict whether income exceeds $50k per year based on the provided. census data provided above. The Datasets consists of a list of records , each of which explains various features of a person along with his income per year. 

<b>A brief description of the features are as follows:</b>
